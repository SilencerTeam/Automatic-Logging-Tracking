# AUTOMATIC LOGGING AND TRACKING SYSTEM
Web application for auto-logging and tracking
## *1. Output :zipper_mouth_face:*
Recorded Demo of the project = https://youtu.be/jynEHndne-g<br/>

## *2. Description :thinking:*
  - We created a webapp using python and streamlit.<br/>
  - We first created separeate folders containing photos of different persons who are allowed for certain rooms(eg. Board of directors room, CEO room, meeting room)
  - We first created three python files(eg. app_1.py, app_2.py, app_3.py) for running the program for three individual rooms. <br/>
  - Then we linked all these separate files to the main python file(eg. app.py).<br/>
  - Then we frontend page using streamlit(i.e view.py).<br/> 
  - We also linked this frontend file(i.e view.py) to the main file(i.e, app.py).<br/>

 ## *3. Working of the web-app üßë‚Äçüéì:*
   - Our solution involves detecting the face of any person who is caught in the camera. We have provided the images of allowed persons in a folder. So if the concerned person caught in camera is allowed then the person will be allowed to enter. In any other case, the person will be marked as Unknown and the alarm will go off allowing the authorities to take any action against the person. Also the website will display a log of WHOs have entered at what TIME and in which ROOM. And also Unknown persons at what TIME and ROOM enhancing ATTENDANCE and SAFETY!!!
